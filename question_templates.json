The total cost of the field trip is the cost of the {transportation} plus the cost of admission for each student. So, the total cost is {transportation_cost} + {admission_cost}{x}. We know that the total cost cannot exceed the budget of {budget}. Therefore, we have the inequality {transportation_cost} + {admission_cost}{x} \u2264 {budget}. To solve for {x}, we subtract {transportation_cost} from both sides of the inequality: {admission_cost}{x} \u2264 {budget_minus_transportation_cost}.
