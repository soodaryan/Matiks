        "question": "Keith bought {new_cards} new baseball trading cards to add to his collection. The next day his dog ate half of his collection. There are now only {cards_left} cards left. How many cards did Keith start with?",
        "solution": "Let's denote the number of cards Keith started with as {initial_cards}. \n\nAccording to the problem, Keith bought {new_cards} new baseball trading cards, so the total number of cards he had after the purchase is {initial_cards} + {new_cards}.\n\nThe next day, his dog ate half of his collection. This means that the number of cards left is half of the total number of cards he had after the purchase. We can express this as ({initial_cards} + {new_cards}) / 2.\n\nWe know from the problem that there are now only {cards_left} cards left. So we can set up the equation:\n\n({initial_cards} + {new_cards}) / 2 = {cards_left}\n\nTo solve for {initial_cards}, we first multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n{initial_cards} + {new_cards} = {cards_left} * 2\n\nThen, we subtract {new_cards} from both sides of the equation to isolate {initial_cards}:\n\n{initial_cards} = ({cards_left} * 2) - {new_cards}\n\nSo, {initial_cards} = {final_answer}.\n\nTherefore, Keith started with {final_answer} baseball trading cards.\n\nSo the answer is $\boxed{{final_answer}}$",

So, the total cost of the pans is ${total_cost} - ${total_pot_cost} = ${total_pan_cost}.\n\nSince each pan is the same price, we can find the cost of one pan by dividing the total cost of the pans by the number of pans.
